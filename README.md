# üß† Employee Attrition Prediction

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **employee attrition** using machine learning models. Employee attrition refers to the gradual reduction of a workforce due to resignations, retirements, or other factors. High attrition rates can significantly affect organizational productivity and increase costs associated with hiring and training new staff.

The goal is to identify patterns and build a predictive model to **anticipate which employees are at risk of leaving**, enabling HR departments to take proactive retention strategies.

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze employee data to discover key factors contributing to attrition.
- Build a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee is likely to leave.
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** to create an interactive web application.
- Allow HR professionals to input employee data and receive real-time attrition risk predictions.
